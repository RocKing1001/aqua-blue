# Guide to install
coming soon (after I finish all the final touches)

# FAQ even doe no one asked

### What is the matrix thing you are using?
Unimatrix

### Why no transparency for terminal
In a VM and I want to maxamise performance
I use ibhagwan's picom fork and the dual kawase blur looks good if performance is not a priority for you and you can try that. For me I dont care either ways, its easier to read text without transparency and vm runs smoother

### What is the weird script in polybar folder
super+ctr+p - opens a power menu. Old script and I dont use it but I used it for making a power button in polybar. I thought it would look good but it dod not so I scrapped it

### \_\_\_\_\_ is bloat, why not use \_\_\_\_\_
simply because this works for me, although I am trying out everything I can find (WM, Terminals etc)

### Why VM?
Because I have hardware with no real support on linux, and it costs too much to throw away. Also I like playing games and windows just works for them. I use linux native on my laptop but typing all of this will be a pain on a laptop so I am using my coding vm

### How long did it take?
No clue, I started 2 months ago but I had many things going on at the time. I would say took about 4 days to a week of time, including all the time I spent researching distros(day), installing arch(an hour), and messing around with polybar (NaN years)
